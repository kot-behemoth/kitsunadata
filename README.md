## About The Project

> [!CAUTION]
> The project is very much in the pre-alpha stage. This is more of an experiment and is not meant for produciton workloads.

This is a concept for what a Rails-inspired small data platform for startups and SMEs could look like. After using a variety of end-to-end solutions like DOMO, Keboola, Mozart Data and others, I keep wishing there was something that would do the 80% of ELT + BI out-of-the-box, without the price surprises.

This project is an attempt to stitch together a set of solid and reliable open-source tools that combine into a lean platform where one data engineer can own the entire lifecycle. From ELT, to data modelling, to deploying and scaling in production.

### Main Features

1. **🧪 From laptop to production in minutes** - Develop locally with DuckDB, deploy with the same code. No more "it works on my machine" problems.

1. **⚡ Lightning-fast analytics on any data size** - DuckDB's column-oriented design handles gigabytes of data on modest hardware. Query billions of rows in seconds.

1. **📊 Beautiful dashboards** - Drag-and-drop dataviz with Metabase. Perfect for everyone - tech and non-tech alike.

1. **💸 Scale without breaking the bank** - Enterprise-grade data stack for as little as $30/month. DuckDB + SQLMesh's efficiency means less compute costs than Snowflake or BigQuery.

1. **🔄 30+ ready-to-use integrations** - Instant integrations with dlt for Stripe, GitHub, Salesforce, and more. Connect your SaaS tools with minimal code.

1. **🤖 Just ask your DB** - Ask questions in plain English with DuckDB's MCP. Get immediate answers without writing complex queries.

1. **🔍 End-to-end data lineage** - SQLMesh tracks transformations from raw to gold data. Understand exactly where metrics come from and debug easily.

### Goals

- Local-first development for the entire stack.
- Support companies that can't afford heavy, expensive data tools or large teams.
- No "SSO tax" - all tools should be either fully free, or affordable once deployed in serious prod use case.
- No k8s, so a small data team can be self-sufficient .
- Cheap path to production and scaling.

### Tech Stack

- _Extract_ (planned): [dlt](https://dlthub.com/)
- Transform: [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Data Storage: [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
- BI / data viz: [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/)
- Deployment: [Dokku](https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/install/digitalocean.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* `uv`
* `mise` (recommended)
* `claude` (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the DuckDB driver for Metabase:
   ```bash
   make download-duckdb-driver
   ```
3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Access Metabase at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

### Deploying to DigitalOcean with Dokku

This project can be deployed to DigitalOcean using Dokku with the following architecture:

1. **Metabase Container**:
   - Dedicated hostname (e.g., metabase.yourdomain.com)
   - Access to mounted DuckDB volume

2. **dlt + SQLMesh Container**:
   - Combined container for data processing
   - Access to the same DuckDB volume

3. **Shared Storage**:
   - DigitalOcean Volume for persistent DuckDB storage

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Create a Dokku-enabled droplet on DigitalOcean**a

  Dokku docs: https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/install/digitalocean.

2. **Deploy using `app.json` configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository on your local machine
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitsuna-data.git
   cd kitsuna-data
   
   # Add Dokku remote
   git remote add dokku dokku@your-droplet-ip:kitsuna-data
   
   # Push to Dokku - this will use the .do/app.yaml configuration
   git push dokku main
   ```

   Dokku will automatically:
   - Create the apps defined in `app.json` 
   - Set up the specified resources
   - Configure the mounts for shared storage
   - Set up the domains

4. **Set up SSL (recommended)**:

   ```bash
   dokku letsencrypt:enable metabase
   ```

This deployment approach gives you:

- Separate containers for Metabase and data processing
- Shared persistent storage for DuckDB
- Simple deployment through Dokku
- Custom domain for Metabase

## Roadmap
